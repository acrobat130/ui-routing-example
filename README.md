# ui-routing-example
Example of Angular UI-Router's nested view capability

# How to run this application
1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. To view the application, do one of the following:
  * Open the `index.html` file in your Chrome browser.
  * In your terminal, navigate to this repository and type `python -m SimpleHTTP Server`. In your Chrome browser, navigate to `localhost:8000`.

# Development
 
I developed this example primarily as a resource or template for others to use when learning how to use the UI-Router in Angular. This example shows several views nested within one another. The UI-Router has this capability whereas the NG-Router does not.
